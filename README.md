# Dataset Name - Covid-19
## URL - https://github.com/datasets/covid-19

The time-series-19-covid-combined table in the covid-19 dataset contains data on country-specific covid-19 instances.This time series data provides below information:
1)show how many people have been impacted by COVID-19 globally.
2)the number of people who supposedly passed away after contracting the coronavirus.
3)how many of them have reportedly made a full recovery.

## Potential applications and values:-
1) Comparative analysis:-The table includes statistics like the numberof deaths reported and the number of confirmed covid cases that were registered .We can research a country's death
 and recovery rates using this data.This study can help us compare the data of high-recovery countries with high-mortality nations, allowing us to evaluate the
 practices employed by high-recovery nations and implement or recommend those practices to nations with high mortality rates in an effort to lower their death rate. 

2) Modelling and forcasting :-We can develop a model that predicts the covid-19 cases in the upcoming days using machine learning methods by using the table's columns cases,deathes,
recoveries as an attributes.

3) Research :- The information can be used to study the characteristics and demographics of the impacted population which can be useful for a more effective and focused reaction.

4) Healthcare Resouce management :- These data can be evaluated and patient loads can be successfully managed by healthcare systems.
